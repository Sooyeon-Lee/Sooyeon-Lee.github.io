excerpt: 'High-valued traders, or intra-marginal traders, can give a market higher transaction rates and generate more profit
both for the traders and for the market maker. In previous CAT tournaments with competing market specialists,
and in accordance with economic theory, markets using registration fee policies attract intra-marginal traders and drive out extra-marginal traders.
We build a simple trader market selection game-theoretic model and simulation to determine how the Nash equilibrium (NE) changes across two markets when a registration fee is charged in one of them.'
