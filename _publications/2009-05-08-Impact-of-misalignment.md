title: "Impact of misalignment of trading agent strategy across multiple markets"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-05-08-Impact-of-misalignment
excerpt: 'We examine the effect of a market pricing policy designed to attract high-valued traders in a multiple market context using JCAT software. Our experiments show that a simple change to pricing policy can create market performance effects that traditional adaptive trading agents are unable to recognize or capitalize on, but that market-policy-aware trading agents can generally obtain. This suggests as parameterized and tunable markets become more common, trading strategies will increasingly need to be conditional on each individual marketâ€™s policies.'
