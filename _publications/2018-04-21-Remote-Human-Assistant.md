excerpt: It is very important for child with visual impairment (CVI) to learn how to interact and engage with sighted peer for their equal social participation and inclusion throughout their life. This brings up benefit and a need of the classroom learning provided by a regular school because it provides great setting for CVI to easily and naturally learn the communication and social skills. For CVI to maximally take the benefit, their full and independent participation in the class activities are needed. However, not much attention has been paid to research that supports interaction and engagement in classroom setting but to an individual level focused learning technology. We propose leveraging a hybrid form of human plus technology assistance that may support CVI in a classroom setting and investigating a feasibility of the hybrid technology with an exploratory study.
