collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-05-04-three-papers
excerpt: 'We used content analysis of in-app driver survey responses, customer support tickets, and tweets, and face-to-face interviews of DHH Uber drivers to better understand the DHH driver experience. Here we describe challenges DHH drivers experience and how they address those difficulties via Uberâ€™s accessibility features and their own workarounds. We also identify and discuss design and product opportunities to improve the DHH driver experience on Uber.'
