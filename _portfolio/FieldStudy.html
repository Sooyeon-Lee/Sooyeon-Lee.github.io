excerpt: "With conducting field studies with ethnographic and participatory design approaches, we learned and understood how people with visual impairments experience and understand world around them and what kind of prosthetic processes and technologies including assistive technologies and collaboration with sighted assistance that they utilize for performing daily tasks and activities, specifically for the shopping task which is an essential and yet found to be challenging task for them."

<h2>Field Study 2: Collaborative Shopping by PVI and the Sighted</h2>
</center>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Being able to contribute in a collaboration is an important aspect of equal participation and full integration. We identified factors related to smooth collaboration between PVI and the sighted partners </li>   
</ul> 

<h3>Designs</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Field observations + in-depth interviews (5 PVI) </li>
    <li> PVI often work with other people to shop (e.g., their partners, including spouse, caseworker, courtesy shoppers) </li>
</ul> 

<h3>Findings - Distinct types of common ground enable satisfying experiences</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Knowledge of how to assist PVI (Caseworker) </li>
    <li> Domain practice (products and/or store) (Courtesy shopper) </li>
    <li> Co-membership and interpersonal relationships (Spouse, friend) </li>
</ul>
