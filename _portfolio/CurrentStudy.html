title: "Current Study: Effective and Pleasant Interaction Dialog Design for Assisting People with Visual Impairment (Work Submitted to CHI)"
collection: portfolio
permalink: /portfolio/CurrentStudy
excerpt: "We are investigating conversation based prosthetic and an interaction that it provides to People with Visual Impairment (PVI) through studying experience of a remote sighted agent at Aira ("https://aira.io/") and PVI from providing assistance to PVI and receiving it from the sighted agent at Aira. We in particular have interests on how conversation modalities (verbal and nonverbal) are utilized and how it is selected for accommodating to context and temporal relevancy and to needs of particular task. Also we are investigating an integration of different kind of modality (e.g. information presented with haptic) into the conversation modality and how it improves guidance support and interaction."

<h2>Study 1: Conversation for Vision for People with Visual Impairment</h2>
</center>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Investigating conversation and interaction occurring via conversational/social prosthetic called Aira (https://aira.io/) between a remote sighted assistant and a person with visual impairment </li>	
  <li> Developing requirements for conversational interaction interface for people with visual impairment </li>
</ul> 
  
<h3>Designs</h3>
<ul>
	<li> Interview Study â€“ 15 remote sighted agents who are employees at Aira company and 8 Aira users with visual impairments </li>
</ul> 

<h3>Findings</h3>
<ul>
	<li> Conversational interaction based assistance is effective and efficient for assisting people with visual impairment </li>
	<li> Conversation style is context dependent and non-verbal communication method is one of the elements of conversation interaction </li>
</ul>
