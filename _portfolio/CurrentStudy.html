<h2>Study 1: Conversation for Vision for People with Visual Impairment</h2>
</center>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Investigating conversation and interaction occurring via conversational/social prosthetic called Aira (https://aira.io/) between a remote sighted assistant and a person with visual impairment </li>	
  <li> Developing requirements for conversational interaction interface for people with visual impairment </li>
</ul> 
  
<h3>Designs</h3>
<ul>
	<li> Interview Study â€“ 15 remote sighted agents who are employees at Aira company and 8 Aira users with visual impairments </li>
</ul> 

<h3>Findings</h3>
<ul>
	<li> Conversational interaction based assistance is effective and efficient for assisting people with visual impairment </li>
	<li> Conversation style is context dependent and non-verbal communication method is one of the elements of conversation interaction </li>
</ul>
