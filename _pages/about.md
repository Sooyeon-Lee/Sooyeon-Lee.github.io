I am currently a fifth year Ph.D. student in the school of [Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/).
My advisor is Professor John M. Carroll and I am working at Laboratory for Computer Supported Collaboration and Learning.
My research interests include accessibility and interactive design in the area of Human Computer Interaction.
Specifically, my research has been focusing on investigating and designing smart camera prosthetics and an interactive dialog interface with a collaboration with AI/Computer vision researchers for people with visual impairments.
In addition, I have industry research experience on designing accessibility for deaf/hard of hearing drivers at Uber Inc.
I also have 5+ years of consumer software product development experience at Minitab Inc.
