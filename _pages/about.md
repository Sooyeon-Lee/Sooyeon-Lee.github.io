I am a Ph.D. student in the school of [Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/).
My advisor is Professor [John M. Carroll](https://jcarroll.ist.psu.edu/) and I am working at [Laboratory for Computer Supported Collaboration and Learning](https://hci.ist.psu.edu/).
My research interests include accessibility and interactive interface design in the area of Human Computer Interaction.
Specifically, my research focuses on designing and developing smart visual prosthetics and an interactive dialog interface for people with visual impairments. In addition, I have industry research experience at Uber focusing on designing accessibility for deaf/hard of hearing drivers and at Google on the topic of inclusive hardware design considering all types of different physical abilities and social diversities. I also have 5+ years of consumer software product development experience at Minitab Inc.
